- For the best experience, Python (2.7+ or 3.x) is recommended for the local server
- Screen resolution of at least 1024x768 for optimal gameplay

## Technical Details

This game uses the following technologies:

- **Three.js** - A JavaScript 3D library
- **Cannon.js** - A physics engine for the web
- **Web Audio API** - For sound effects and music
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - For UI and styling

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Game won't start**:
   - Make sure you have a modern browser with WebGL support
   - Try installing Python for the local web server functionality

3. **Sound issues**:
   - Check if your browser has sound permissions
   - Make sure your system volume is on
   - Click somewhere on the game window to enable audio (browser policy)
